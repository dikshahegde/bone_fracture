# 🦴 Fracture Detection using YOLOv8  

## 📌 Overview  
Bone fractures are a common medical issue requiring accurate and timely diagnosis. This project aims to automate fracture detection using **YOLOv8**, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. By training on annotated medical images, this deep-learning model can efficiently detect fractures in X-ray images.  

The primary objective of this project is to **improve the efficiency of fracture detection** and **reduce the dependency on manual diagnosis**. With a well-trained model, the detection process becomes faster, more reliable, and applicable in medical research and real-world hospital applications.
